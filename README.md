# miditogd
a python script for converting .midi files to gd sfx triggers

this is moreso meant for personal use, so actually using it is a little tricky

the script spits out raw block data for all of the sfx triggers, which you can then append onto a level using [gmdtools](https://gdcolon.com/gmd_tools) by gdcolon
